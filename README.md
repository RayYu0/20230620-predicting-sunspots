This research examines the accuracy of predicting the number of sunspots on a given day. 
Sunspots are crucial for understanding space weather, which is capable of interfering with the 
climate, global positioning systems as well as other crucial applications for the functioning 
of society (1). Therefore, accurate predictions can lessen the impacts on space technologies. 
This study utilizes sunspot data from 1848 to 2019 to train and assess the mode. Root mean 
squared error (RMSE) will be used for evaluating accuracy. 

The main goal of this study is to observe how the number of days worth of data impacts the 
accuracy of the random forest model. Additionally, this research investigates how the number 
of days given for training affects running time. After evaluating the model, this study finds 
the model to be most accurate when around 25 days of data are given.
